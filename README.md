# Pneumonia-Detection-with-Deep-Learning

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images and detect pneumonia using the Kaggle Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset. The model is developed with TensorFlow and leverages advanced techniques to address class imbalance in the dataset.
